                        by
                        2040. Thanks to the hard work and dedication of our around 74,000 employees, we are one of

                        few

                <div class="div-about">
                    <p class="p-text"><strong>THE FUTURE OF CONSTRUCTION</strong> is a European-based technology group
                        for
                        construction
                        services, a leader
                        in innovation and financial
                        strength. Our services span all areas of the construction industry. We create added value for
                        our
                        clients by our specialised entities integrating the most diverse services and assuming
                        responsibility for them. We bring together people, materials and machinery at the right place
                        and at
                        the right time in order to realise even complex construction projects – on schedule, of the
                        highest
                        quality and at the best price. In short: We assume a part of the risk, thus relieving our
                        clients.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Thanks to the hard work and dedication of our around 74,000 employees, we are one

                        time, a dense network of numerous subsidiaries in many European countries and on other
                        continents is
                        helping to expand our area of operation far beyond the borders of Austria and Germany. This
                        broad
                        diversification puts us in a position to build cost- and resource-effectively.

                        that
                        Architecture can be made to seem “alive” with the intention that this will engender a deeper and
