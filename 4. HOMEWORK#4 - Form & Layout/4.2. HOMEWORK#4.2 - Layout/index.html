                <h3>Inside Meta's Oversight Board: 2 Years of Pushing Limits</h3>
                <div>
                    <h4>Mark Zuckerberg set up the panel to investigate how his company handles controversial posts. Now
                        its members want to transform how social platforms work.</h4>
                    <p>ON THE MORNING of Thursday, June 30, 2022, two large luxury buses pulled up to a grand hotel in
                        Menlo Park, California. Milling on the driveway were the members, staffers, and trustees of the
                        Oversight Board. Set up two years ago by Facebook, now Meta, this august gaggle exists to
                        second-guess the
                        company's most controversial actions. The board members, who'd already logged countless hours on
                        video calls and email, were spending their first week together in person. The buses rumbled off,
                        whisking the 23 Zoom buddies to Meta's headquarters 4 miles away.</p>
                    <img width="600px" src="/assets/meta.jpg" alt="meta image">
                    <p>The group made its way across the mammoth Gehry-designed complex to a verdant outdoor
                        amphitheater
                        known as the Bowl. Sheryl Sandberg, Meta's outgoing chief operating officer, greeted the crowd
                        in
                        the midday heat. Next up was Nick Clegg, the company's president for global affairs. Clegg was
                        almost startling in his effusive praise of the board. He was taking questions from the members
                        when,
                        suddenly, the large screens in the Bowl lit up with a familiar face.</p>
                    <pre>To this day, Facebook and Instagram users are not guaranteed that when some robot blocks their speech, a human being will ever see their complaints.</pre>

                <h3>The 'Viral' Secure Programming Language That's Taking Over Tech</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>Rust makes it impossible to introduce some of the most common security vulnerabilities. And its
                        adoption can't come soon enough.</p>
                    <p><span>WHETHER YOU RUN IT </span>for a massive organization or simply own a smartphone, you're
                        intimately
                        familiar with the unending stream of software updates that constantly need to be installed
                        because of
                        bugs and security vulnerabilities. People make mistakes, so code is inevitably going to contain
                        mistakes—you get it. But a growing movement to write software in a language called Rust is
                        gaining momentum because the code is goof-proof in an important way. By design, developers can't
                        accidentally create the most common types of exploitable security vulnerabilities when they're
                        coding in Rust, a distinction that could make a huge difference in the daily patch parade and
                        ultimately the world's baseline cybersecurity.</p>
                    <p>There are fads in programming languages, and new ones come and go, often without lasting impact.
                        Now 12 years old, Rust took time to mature from the side project of a Mozilla researcher into a
                        robust ecosystem. Meanwhile, the predecessor language C, which is still widely used today,
                        turned 50
                        this year. But because Rust produces more secure code and, crucially, doesn't worsen performance
                        to
                        do it, the language has been steadily gaining adherents and now is at a turning point.
                        Microsoft,
                        Google, and Amazon Web Services have all been utilizing Rust since 2019, and the three companies
                        formed the nonprofit Rust Foundation with Mozilla and Huawei in 2020 to sustain and grow the
                        language. And after a couple of years of intensive work, the Linux kernel took its first steps
                        last month to implement Rust support.</p>

                <h3>GitHub Moves to Guard Open Source Against Supply Chain Attacks</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>The popular Microsoft-owned code repository plans to roll out code signing, which will help beef
                        up the security of open source projects.</p>
                    <img width="100px"

                        alt="github logo">
                    <p><span>FOLLOWING THE 2020</span> SolarWinds cyberespionage campaign, in which Russian hackers
                        slipped tainted
                        updates into a widely used IT management platform, a series of further software supply chain
                        attacks continues to highlight the urgent need to lock down software chains of custody. And the
                        issue is particularly pressing in open source, where projects are inherently decentralized and
                        often ad hoc endeavors. After a series of worrying compromises to widely downloaded JavaScript
                        software packages from the prominent “npm” registry, which is owned by GitHub, the company laid
                        out a plan this week to offer expanded defenses for open source security.</p>
                    <p>GitHub, which itself is owned by Microsoft, announced on Monday that it plans to support code
                        signing, a sort of digital wax seal, for npm software packages using the code-signing platform
                        Sigstore. The tool grew out of cross-industry collaboration to make it much easier for open
                        source maintainers to verify that the code they create is the same code that ends up in the
                        software packages actually being downloaded by people worldwide.</p>
                    <p><em>
                            <blockquote><q>While most npm packages are open source, there's currently no guarantee that
                                    a package on
                                    npm is built from the same source code that's published,” says Justin Hutchings,
                                    GitHub's
                                    director of product management. “Supply chain attacks are on the rise, and adding
                                    signed
                                    build information to open source packages that validates where the software came
                                    from
                                    and
                                    how it was built is a great way to reduce the attack surface.</q></blockquote>
                        </em></p>
                    <p>In other words, it's all about creating a cryptographically verified and transparent game of
                        telephone. </p>

                        to spectacular fjords. Here, you can admire the mountains of Fiordland National Park, a UNESCO
                        World Heritage Site, from hiking trails or a boat on Milford Sound. At night, journey to the
                        University of Canterbury's Mount John Observatory to gaze at the starry skies. You can also
                        indulge your inner daredevil in Queenstown (a favorite destination among bungee jumpers), sample
                        delicious sauvignon blanc wine in the Marlborough region or explore New Zealand's most
                        accessible glaciers - Franz Josef and Fox Glacier - on the island's west coast.</p>

                <h3>Bora Bora</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>What this small French Polynesian island may lack in size it makes up for in sheer tropical
                        beauty. Here, you'll find picturesque beaches, lush jungles and luxurious resorts. The island's
                        extinct volcano, Mount Otemanu, makes for a great photo-op or challenging hike, and the friendly
                        Bora Bora locals can help you catch a glimpse of the island's best sights during an off-road
                        excursion. To relax, head to Matira Beach for crystal-clear water and soft white sand. Although
                        a trip to Bora Bora is very expensive, most travelers say it's worth every penny.</p>
                    <p>The small island of Bora Bora (just about 6 miles long and a little more than 2 miles wide)
                        overflows with beauty. A dormant volcano rises up at its center and fans out into lush jungle
                        before spilling into an aquamarine lagoon. In fact, author James Michener, who wrote "Tales of
                        the South Pacific," called Bora Bora "the most beautiful island in the world." The 18th-century
                        British explorer James Cook even coined it as the "Pearl of the Pacific." The very definition of
                        a tropical getaway, blissful Bora Bora abounds with luxurious resorts, sunny skies, warm waters
                        and friendly locals. </p>
                    <img src="/assets/bora bora.gif" alt="bora bora">
                    <p>The main objective of a Bora Bora vacation is relaxation and this small island offers innumerable
                        ways to achieve it. Repose on the deck of your overwater bungalow, cool off in the luminous
                        lagoon surrounding Bora Bora or bike around the island at a leisurely pace. When you have some
                        energy to burn, we suggest checking out the underwater life at the Bora Bora Lagoonarium and the
                        Coral Gardens. For a taste of the local culture, take a jaunt into Vaitape. And whether you
                        photograph it at a distance or climb its rocky slopes, Mount Otemanu is a must-see.</p>

                    <img width="600px" src="/assets/cristiano ronaldo.jpg" alt="cristiano ronaldo">
                    <p>Ronaldo promised in August he would give his version of life at Old Trafford after failing to
                        secure a move away from United to a club playing in the Champions League, as he had hoped.
                        The veteran Portuguese has now broken his silence in a wide-ranging interview with Piers Morgan
                        for TalkTV. Manchester United have been asked for a response to Ronaldo's claims.</p>
                    <p>When asked if United's hierarchy were trying to force him out of the club, Ronaldo said: <q>Yes,
                            not only the coach [Erik ten Hag], but another two or three guys around the club. I felt
                            betrayed.</q>
                        When quizzed again if senior club executives were trying to oust him, the 37-year-old said: <q>I
                            don't care. People should listen to the truth.</q>
                        <q>Yes, I felt betrayed and I felt like some people don't want me here, not only this year but
                            last year too.</q>
                        Ronaldo has not played because of an unspecified illness since he captained United in their 3-1
                        defeat at Aston Villa on 6 November.

                    <p>Hamilton dropped to ninth place after the collision with his 2021 title rival but came back to
                        secure a Mercedes one-two and seal the team's recovery after a difficult season that the
                        eight-time champions started with an uncompetitive car.</p>
